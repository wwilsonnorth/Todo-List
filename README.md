# Todo List
This application was built as part of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course.

A simple To-do List application that allows you to add new tasks, cross completed tasks off and completely delete them from the list when they are no longer needed. Clicking the pen and paper icon in the title bar hides the text box for a minimal look.
