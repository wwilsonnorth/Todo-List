# Todo List
This project was built as part of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course.

HTML, CSS & JavaScript used. A simple To-do List application that allows you to add new tasks, cross completed tasks off and completely delete them from the list when they are no longer needed. Clicking the icon in the title bar hides the text box for a minimalist look.

See screenshot in files for a preview or download to try for yourself!
